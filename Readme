Project Overview
This project allows you to control the position of a servo motor remotely using a smartphone app (Blynk) and an ESP8266 microcontroller. The servo position can be adjusted by moving a slider in the Blynk app. This system can be used for various applications such as opening doors, controlling robots, or adjusting camera angles.

Components Needed:
ESP8266 (NodeMCU or similar)
Servo Motor (SG90 or similar)
Blynk App (installed on your smartphone)
Jumper Wires
Breadboard (optional)
Power source (USB for ESP8266)

							
Wiring:
Servo Motor:
VCC to 3.3V (or 5V depending on the servo) of the ESP8266
GND to GND of the ESP8266
Signal pin to any GPIO pin (e.g., D4 or GPIO2)


							
Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE with ESP8266 board package installed
Blynk Library for Arduino
Servo Library (usually pre-installed with Arduino IDE)


How It Works:
The Blynk app slider widget controls the servo motor.
The slider is mapped to a range from 0 to 180 degrees, corresponding to the angle of the servo motor.
When you move the slider, the position is sent to the ESP8266 via Blynk, and the ESP8266 adjusts the servo accordingly.


              
Setting Up the Blynk App:
Create a new project in the Blynk app.
Add a slider widget and set it to control Virtual Pin V1.
Set the range of the slider to 0-180 (which corresponds to the angle of the servo).
Copy the Auth Token generated by the Blynk app into the code.


              
Optional Enhancements:
Add feedback from the servo to the Blynk app.
Use additional sensors to trigger servo movement automatically.
Control multiple servos from the same ESP8266.
